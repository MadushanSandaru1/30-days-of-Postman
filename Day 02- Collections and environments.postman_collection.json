Expand the context bar on the right to follow the instructions in the collection documentation.Remember, if you find it bothersome to navigate between the documentation while working in a different area of Postman, you can open a new tab to keep your place in the documentation, and then switch between tabs.\n3.  **Submit your solution:** Select the second folder `Submit your solution` and follow the instructions in the documentation to validate your solution.\n    \n\n## Concepts covered\n\n*   [Adding requests](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/intro-to-collections/#adding-requests)\n*   [Creating environments](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/#creating-environments)\n*   [Postman API](https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/intro-api/)\n    \n\n## Additional resources\n\n*   [Postman Environments: How to Control Access to Variables, Workflows, and More](https://blog.postman.com/postman-environments-how-to-control-access-to-variables-workflows-and-more/) blog\n*   [Initial vs Current Values for Variables](https://youtu.be/I6vClap0ajU) video\n*   [Collections and environments](https://www.tiktok.com/@joycejetson/video/7061999729462250799) tiktok\n    \n\n## Next challenge\n\n*   [Add request details](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/30-days-of-postman-for-developers/documentation/1559645-969f4824-25ba-4ed6-8926-f71ce4ee079d)",

The value for this new variable should be the part you copied from the request URL in the previous step. You can enter it under both `INITIAL VALUE` and `CURRENT VALUE`. Remember to select the new environment as the active environment so Postman will read in the values properly.\n\n  If you hover over the variable <code>\\{{baseURL\\}}</code> in the request URL, you should see Postman reading in the variable value from the actively selected environment. Now that you've stored the base URL in a variable named `baseURL`, you can reference it in your requests using <code>\\{{baseURL\\}}</code>. If the base URL value is `https://postman-echo.com`, and is listed as part of the request URL using <code>\\{{baseURL\\}}/post</code>, Postman will send the request to `https://postman-echo.com/post`. Save your changes in the collection and environment.\n1. **Add a request:** Rename the request from `echo` to `POST raw text`. Then, duplicate the request in this folder, and rename the second request `GET with query params`. Update the new request HTTP method to `GET` and update the request URL from `/post` to `/get`. Add two [query parameters](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#sending-parameters). This can be anything you like, for example, `foo` and `bar` or `name` and `ferret`. **Send** to make sure you get a 200 status code.\n\nOnce you complete these steps, move on to the next folder in this collection to submit your solution."

Then in the context bar to the right, select the `Info` icon and copy the collection `ID`. Make sure you're getting the `ID` for the collection, and not this request.\n1. **Update the request URL:** Update the `collection_uid` in the request URL with the collection `ID` from the previous step, using any method you prefer. \n1. **Get your Postman API key**: Get your [Postman API key](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys) and make a new environment variable called `postman_api_key`, so that Postman can authorize your request as shown under the **Headers** tab. Paste the API key under `CURRENT VALUE` (and not `INITIAL VALUE`).\n> ‚ö† DON'T LEAK YOUR SECRETS! \n> It's very important to add sensitive values like an API key to the `CURRENT VALUE` (and not `INITIAL VALUE`) of your public workspace since initial values can be viewed publicly in a public workspace. Storing sensitive values only in `CURRENT VALUE` keeps your secrets private in a team or public workspace. If you accidentally show your API key, [revoke and regenerate your API key](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys).\n\n  An environment can be used with other collections. Keep it handy, so we can use it in upcoming challenges.\n1. **Validate your solution**: Save your changes in the collection and environment. Hit **Send** and look under the **Tests** tab of the server response at the bottom to review your test results.\n\nIf you have any failures, review the failed test results or ask for support in the [community forum](https://community.postman.com/). When all of your tests pass, you are done with today's challenge. Remember to save your changes as you'll need to pass all the challenges to claim a **30 days of Postman** badge."
