		"description": "## Instructions for Day 00: Pre-requisites\n\n1. **Sign in to Postman:** Create a Postman account if you don't have one already, and log into [Postman for the web](https://go.postman.co) in your browser.\n  - To use Postman in a web browser, download and run the [Postman agent](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) on your local machine to overcome cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) limitations. The agent is not the same as the app. On a Mac, you will see an icon for the Postman agent running in the status menu at the top right of your computer screen. On a Windows machine, the Postman agent icon displays in the system tray at the bottom right of your computer screen.\n  - If you don't want to use Postman in a web browser with the agent, you can instead download and install the Postman app for Mac, Windows, or Linux.\n1. **Create a public workspace**: [Create a new Postman workspace](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/#creating-a-public-workspace) with visibility set to `Public` to show your work. Every day, fork a new challenge from [the parent workspace](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/30-days-of-postman-for-developers/overview) to your own, and work through the day's challenge. Change the name of your public workspace to deter others from directly copying your answers. \n1. **Set an email notification (optional)**: If you want to receive an email reminder every day for 30 days, follow the instructions in the folder `Email notification`.\n\nAnd that's all for today! Stick with your challenges for 30 days, and sharpen your Postman skills.\n\n## Concepts covered\n- [Creating a public workspace](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/#creating-a-new-workspace)\n- [Agent for the Postman web client](https://youtu.be/6xlJUx2ZMy4) video\n- [Monitoring](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/monitoring-your-api/monitoring-apis-websites/)\n\n## Next challenge\n- [Fork a collection](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/30-days-of-postman-for-developers/documentation/1559645-02f21db3-4424-4a4d-8bae-1b1fe1f75987)",
